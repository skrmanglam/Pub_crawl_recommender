"""Using Langchain and vector similarity search to perform RAG"""

# NLP.py
# Functionality: Vector similarity search for RAG using Langchain

from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import pinecone

# Assuming model initialization and Pinecone setup are done as per temp.py

def embed_query(query):
    # Embed a user query
    return sentence_model.encode(query)

def perform_similarity_search(query_embedding):
    # Perform vector similarity search with Pinecone
    query_results = index.query([query_embedding.tolist()], top_k=5)
    return query_results

# Integration with the querying function might require adjustments
# based on temp.py's structure and Pinecone's API usage
